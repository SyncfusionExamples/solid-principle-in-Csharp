# SOLID principle in C#
This repository provides a comprehensive guide and practical examples of implementing the SOLID principles in C#. SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. The principles are:

1.	**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
2.	**Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3.	**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
4.	**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5.	**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
